Portfolio
============

Here's a collection of projects I'm particularly proud of.

Products
----------

These are whole-scale web applications I've either engineered, or have contributed toward.
Some will include full-stack development, while others are consolidated front-ends. Either way,
they are considered finished products.

- [Budgetable](/portfolio/budgetable.html)
  <br />
  A budget management and personal finance forecasting tool.
- [Wage Calculator](/portfolio/wagecalculator.html)
  <br />
  A simple serverless web application for comparing wage rates.

Command-Line Tools
----------------------

These are some command-line tools I've developed over the years.

- [Î»text](/portfolio/ltext.html)
  <br />
  A templating engine for text files, inspired by functional programming.

Libraries
-----------

Here are some libraries I've developed.

- [IntSet.js](/portfolio/intset.html)
  <br />
  A set implementation for `bigint`s.
- [Shpadoinkle](/portfolio/shpadoinkle.html)
