abstract:
  Budgetable is a budget management and personal finance forecasting tool. It doesn't store any
  financial information on any server, and performs all calculations in the browser. The front-end
  is written in Rust, and the microservices are written in Haskell. It is a proof-of-concept for
  writing a complete application with Auth0 logins and registration, Stripe payment processing,
  and PostgREST as a persistent storage system.
